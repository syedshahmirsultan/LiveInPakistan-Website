The national dress, Shalwar Kameez, is worn by both men and women and symbolizes the nation&apos;s cultural identity. In urban areas, Western attire is also common, especially among the younger generation. Traditional dresses vary by region; for instance, Sindhi Ajrak and Balochi embroidered dresses are renowned for their intricate designs, while Punjabis often wear vibrant, colorful attire. Festivals play a significant role in Pakistani culture, with Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha being the most widely celebrated religious holidays, marked by communal prayers, feasting, and giving charity. Basant, the kite-flying festival in Punjab, brings a burst of color to the skies, while the Sindhi Topi and Ajrak Day celebrate Sindhi heritage. Weddings in Pakistan are grand, multi-day events filled with customs like Mehndi, where hands are decorated with henna. The traditional music and dance, including Bhangra and Luddi, add a festive spirit to celebrations.
